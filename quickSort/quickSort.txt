Quicksort Algorithm:

    Base Case:
        If the array has one or zero elements, it is already sorted, and no further action is needed.

    Choose Pivot:
        Choose a pivot element from the array. The pivot can be any element, but for simplicity, we'll choose the last element.

    Partition:
        Partition the array into two subarrays:
            Elements less than or equal to the pivot.
            Elements greater than the pivot.
        This step rearranges the elements such that the pivot is in its final sorted position.

    Recursive Calls:
        Recursively apply the Quicksort algorithm to the left and right subarrays.
        Repeat steps 1-3 for each subarray.
